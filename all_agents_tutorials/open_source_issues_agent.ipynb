    "# Open Source Issue Agent\n",
    "Build an AI-powered agent that accepts an open-source GitHub issue link, analyzes the issue, gathers information about the relevant codebase, and generates a comprehensive plan to guide developers on how to approach and resolve the issue.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Contributing to open source is an incredible way to grow as a developer, enhance your skills, and make a positive impact on the tech community. However, for many of us, especially first-timers, the journey can feel daunting. With countless projects and issues to sift through, itâ€™s often overwhelming. Despite the availability of platforms that list open issues, there remains a steep learning curve to navigate complex codebases and identify tasks that align with one's expertise.\n",
